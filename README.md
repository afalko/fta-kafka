# Presentation

On May 27, 2019 I gave the following presentation at SRECON: 
[SRECON'19: Fault Tree Analysis Applied to Apache Kafka](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19americas/presentation/falko)

# Fault Trees

Fault Trees are exported as SVGs by [SCRAM-PRA](https://github.com/rakhimov/scram), the tool that 
was used in this presentation. They are listed below in the order 
in which they appeared.
